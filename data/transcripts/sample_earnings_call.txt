PREPARED REMARKS

John Smith - Chief Executive Officer: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today for TechCorp's third quarter 2024 earnings call. I'm pleased to report strong financial results that exceeded our expectations. Revenue for the quarter was $1.5 billion, representing 15% growth year-over-year. This growth was driven by exceptional performance across all of our business segments, particularly in our cloud services division.

Our operating margin expanded to 22%, up from 19% in the prior year period. We achieved earnings per share of $2.50, beating consensus estimates by $0.15. These results demonstrate the strength of our business model and the successful execution of our strategic initiatives.

Looking ahead, we remain optimistic about our growth prospects. We expect to achieve revenue of approximately $1.6 billion in Q4, which would represent roughly 12% growth year-over-year. We are committed to maintaining strong profitability while investing in innovation and market expansion.

Sarah Johnson - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, John. I'll provide some additional details on our financial performance. Cash flow from operations was $450 million in Q3, up 25% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with $2.8 billion in cash and equivalents, providing us with significant financial flexibility.

Our gross margin was 65%, consistent with the prior quarter. Operating expenses increased by 8% year-over-year, which was slightly below our revenue growth rate, demonstrating good operational leverage. R&D spending was $180 million, representing 12% of revenue, as we continue to invest in product development.

We returned $200 million to shareholders through our share repurchase program during the quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong with a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.3. We are well-positioned financially to execute on our strategic priorities.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Operator: We will now begin the question and answer session. Our first question comes from Michael Chen with Goldman Sachs.

Michael Chen - Goldman Sachs: Good afternoon. Congratulations on the strong results. Can you provide more color on the cloud services segment? What drove the acceleration in growth this quarter?

John Smith - Chief Executive Officer: Thanks for the question, Michael. The cloud services segment grew 28% year-over-year to $600 million in revenue. This acceleration was driven by several factors. First, we saw strong uptake of our new AI-powered analytics platform, which launched in July. Second, we benefited from increased enterprise adoption as companies continue to migrate workloads to the cloud. Third, our strategic partnerships with major system integrators are yielding results.

We're particularly encouraged by the expansion in average revenue per customer, which increased 15% year-over-year to approximately $125,000 annually. Customer retention rates remain strong at 95%, and we added 1,200 new enterprise customers during the quarter.

Michael Chen - Goldman Sachs: That's helpful. As a follow-up, can you discuss the competitive environment? Are you seeing any pricing pressure?

Sarah Johnson - Chief Financial Officer: On the competitive front, the market remains dynamic but rational. While there are multiple players in the space, we've been able to maintain our pricing power due to our differentiated technology and strong customer relationships. We haven't seen significant pricing pressure. In fact, our average selling prices increased slightly year-over-year, reflecting the value customers are finding in our platform.

Operator: Our next question comes from Jennifer Rodriguez with Morgan Stanley.

Jennifer Rodriguez - Morgan Stanley: Hi, thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask about your operating expense outlook. You mentioned 8% growth this quarter. How should we think about operating leverage going forward?

Sarah Johnson - Chief Financial Officer: That's a great question, Jennifer. We expect operating expenses to grow at a slower rate than revenue as we continue to scale the business. For Q4, we anticipate operating expenses to be in the range of $640 million to $660 million, which would represent growth of about 6-7% year-over-year. This reflects our focus on operational efficiency while continuing to invest in key growth areas.

We're being disciplined about headcount additions, leveraging automation where possible, and focusing on high-ROI investments. Over the longer term, we believe we can achieve meaningful operating leverage, though we'll continue to invest appropriately in R&D and sales capacity to support our growth objectives.

Jennifer Rodriguez - Morgan Stanley: And just to clarify, does that operating expense guidance include any restructuring costs or is that purely operational spending?

Sarah Johnson - Chief Financial Officer: That's purely operational spending. We don't have any significant restructuring activities planned for Q4. The guidance I provided represents our normal run-rate operating expenses.

Operator: Our next question comes from David Park with JPMorgan.

David Park - JPMorgan: Thanks for the question. I'd like to understand the guidance for Q4 revenue. It implies some deceleration from the 15% growth you achieved this quarter. Can you walk us through the factors behind that?

John Smith - Chief Executive Officer: Sure, David. The Q4 guidance of approximately 12% growth reflects a few considerations. First, we have a difficult comparison as Q4 last year benefited from a large one-time contract that contributed about $50 million. Excluding that, the underlying growth would be closer to 14%. 

Second, we're taking a somewhat conservative approach given the macroeconomic uncertainties we're monitoring. While we haven't seen softness in customer demand, we think it's prudent to be cautious in our outlook. Third, there's typical seasonality in our business where Q4 can be slightly softer than Q3 as enterprise buying cycles wind down toward year-end.

That said, our pipeline remains robust and we're confident in our ability to deliver these results.

Operator: Thank you. That concludes our question and answer session. I'll now turn the call back to John Smith for closing remarks.

John Smith - Chief Executive Officer: Thank you all for joining us today. We're proud of our Q3 performance and remain focused on executing our strategy. We believe we're well-positioned for continued growth and value creation for our shareholders. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Have a great day.

Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.
